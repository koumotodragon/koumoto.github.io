				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://ianhvideo.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/camera-690163_1280.jpg" class="themewich-lightbox"><img class="normal alignnone size-medium wp-image-253" src="http://ianhvideo.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/camera-690163_1280-600x400.jpg" alt="camera-690163_1280" width="300" height="200" srcset="https://harringtonweddings.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/camera-690163_1280-600x400.jpg 600w, https://harringtonweddings.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/camera-690163_1280-960x640.jpg 960w, https://harringtonweddings.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/camera-690163_1280.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>We interact with video subjects on a daily basis, and only a small percentage of our subjects are seasoned actors. Typically, our video subjects are business owners adding a personal branded touch to their websites, hopeful entrepreneurs marketing their products on Kickstarter, or wedding guests celebrating a magical day together. A question we often get asked by clients is “how do I look natural on camera?” So we wanted to share the insights that we have gained in the last few years of filming people. Acting natural on camera is a lot harder than it sounds.</p>
<p>Here are six effective ways to help you feel more natural on camera.</p>
<p>1. <strong>Practice, practice, practice!</strong></p>
<p>Even if you’re familiar with the subject matter being covered in your video&#8211;practice is important! Familiarize yourself with your script, what ideas you want to convey and even how you’d like your voice to sound. If being in front of the camera makes you nervous, do a few practice runs in front of a camera without filming. The more you practice with the camera in front of you, the more comfortable you’ll get with it.</p>
<p>2. <strong>Wear something you feel comfortable in.</strong></p>
<p>Even if you have to wear formal attire in your video, be sure it’s clothing you feel comfortable wearing. If you are able to be flexible with your video wardrobe, pick items that fit your body. And don’t be afraid to add accents or accessories that showcase your personality—just be sure to keep distracting jewelry to a minimum to keep your viewers focused on you. If you are wearing clothing you feel uncomfortable wearing—it will show. Feeling good about yourself and your outfit will make you appear natural and confident on camera.</p>
<p>3. <strong>Relax and don’t forget to breathe.</strong></p>
<p>On-camera jitters can happen, even when you have rehearsed and memorized your script. Practice whatever helps calm your nerves down before sitting in front of a camera. Many video subjects will go for a quick walk, meditate, or listen to music. Once you’ve collected yourself—don’t forget to breathe easy when the camera is filming as well.</p>
<p>4. <strong>Pace yourself.</strong></p>
<p>We can’t stress this enough. Many video subjects rush through scripts without even realizing they’re doing it. If you seem rushed during your speech or spiel, your audience may see you as unreliable or unprofessional. Pace your words and use language that is colloquial (in most cases). Simple words are best for videos, so that you can easily communicate with your audience.</p>
<p>5.<strong> Mind your movement.</strong></p>
<p>Body language is important! The camera tends to exaggerate movement because you are the main focus. So be sure to sit up or stand up straight—no slouching. Good posture conveys confidence. If you tend to fidget while talking, find a comfortable place to plant your hands. These may seem like minor details but your audience will notice!</p>
<p>6. <strong>Don’t worry too much!</strong></p>
<p>If you’re still nervous about your on-camera stint, just remember that the right professional videographer can edit your video to perfection. Obviously, videographers aren’t magicians but they are exceptionally great at creating moments and making them look seamless. Even if you mess up, a videographer can piece together the moments that worked. So really, don’t stress! With the right professional crew to back you up—you have everything you need to make your video great.</p>

		<title>What Your Web Video is Missing: And Why You Need to Shoot 4k</title>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://ianhvideo.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/shutterstock_158850965.jpg" class="themewich-lightbox"><img class="normal alignnone size-medium wp-image-246" src="http://ianhvideo.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/shutterstock_158850965-600x400.jpg" alt="shutterstock_158850965" width="300" height="200" /></a></p>
<p><strong>What is 4k resolution?</strong></p>
<p>4k resolution refers to content that has a resolution of 4,000 pixels. In laymen’s terms, that’s a lot of pixels. Although 4k technology hasn’t gone mainstream quite yet, digital junkies and video professionals have already converted. If visual media is your life’s work, you need to be shooting in 4k. 4k resolution is the new definition of HD TV.</p>
<p><strong>4 Reasons Why You Need to Shoot in 4k</strong></p>
<p>There’s been a bit of controversy on the topic of 4k resolution—and whether or not it’s worth it. At the moment, most media consumption takes place outside of the 4k realm. You can’t watch TV with cable on a 4k TV screen. So why bother? Here are four reasons why you need to shoot in 4k.</p>
<p><strong>Sharper Overall Footage</strong></p>
<p>If you make and share web video content, you want your video to be the best possible quality. Right? You owe it to your audience. 4k resolution footage is the size of 4 standard 1080p video files and when shrunken down you get the sharpest 1080p final export possible. The overall image quality will be far greater than today’s HD standard.</p>
<p><strong>Improved Pans and Zooms</strong></p>
<p>Even novice videographers know that trying to film a smooth pan with a video camera is near impossible. And trying to zoom with a manual lens is actually impossible. Shooting in 4k allows videographers to pan and zoom to their hearts content. You can zoom and pan from your computer instead of in the field. Your finished product will look stunning and seamless.</p>
<p><strong>Shoot A and B Roll Simultaneously</strong></p>
<p>Shooting in 4k resolution can make filming your next interview much easier. Gone are the days of using multiple cameras to shoot A and B roll. 4k cameras allow videographers to export in 1080p for multiple shot options from wife to medium to tight angles—all using just one 4k camera.</p>
<p><strong>Still Frames</strong></p>
<p>4k cameras are changing the game when it comes to still frame images. Before 4k technology, videographers could not use still frame images because they were too low res. 4k resolution enables videographers to grab still frame images that aren’t embarrassingly blurry for their web content.</p>
<p><strong>Staying Ahead of the Curve</strong></p>
<p>Despite all the advantages of shooting in 4k, it is still not a household format for many videographers. 4k may not seem relevant at the moment, but all the major digital consumer brands are embracing it. Tastemakers like YouTube, iPhone, and GoPro are all jumping on the 4k bandwagon because they want to stay ahead of the curve. Ensure that your digital footage is not left in the dark when the inevitable switch occurs by shooting in 4k.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The art of successful business video craftsmanship revolves around finding a delicate balance between informative and entertaining. Piecing together a concise video that articulates what your business has to offer is easier said than done. But we can’t stress the importance of adding a corporate video to your marketing plan. Videos are fantastic mediums to convey a lot of information about your company in a quick and cost-effective way.</p>
<p>Here’s a look at five corporate videos that we can’t stop watching:</p>
<p>Dollar Shave Club</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZUG9qYTJMsI" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>This under two-minute video manages to be hilarious and informative all at once. Questions are answered about the service and delivered in a compelling way by the CEO of Dollar Shave Club. The CEO also subtly explains why this service is better than others without coming off as “salesy” or disingenuous. The product offering is clear and the target demographic is made apparent, but the video is entertaining for all audiences.</p>
<p>Airbnb</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lVIz0ZbJikw" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>This video does a great job at explaining what Airbnb is and does, but most importantly it touches on the emotional benefit of being an Airbnb host. As a host, you play an important role in the Airbnb ecosystem; you are the catalyst to people living their dreams. Making an emotional connection with your audience is so important and Airbnb does this exceptionally well.</p>
<p>Slack</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/B6zVzWU95Sw" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>This video is able to explain technical software in accessible terms—and does so in a humorous way. The video not only communicates what Slack does, but explains the value of implementation. Addressing a pain point that your product alleviates is an extremely important topic to cover in your business video, and Slack does this impeccably well.</p>
<p>Lyft</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-ghcjvXVcSQ" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>The idea of a community is very important to the Lyft brand, and this video helps communicate that very well. This video also does a great job at showing how the entire Lyft process works from user to driver. Today’s discerning audience enjoys and expects a certain level of transparency from businesses—and Lyft video delivers just that.</p>
<p>SkyLock</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6gyLPjDakAc" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>SkyLock’s corporate video is a great example of how to produce a “show me, don’t tell me” video. Businesses with physical products should always show how the product works, and SkyLock’s video does that while being hilariously entertaining.</p>
<p>Business videos are a great way to market your product, service or company. Videos are very sharable pieces of content that you can add to your website or social media pages.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Videos can be a great asset for promoting your business. A well-made video can help set apart your business and add a face (or a few faces) to your company name. With the wide range of products and services available to consumers, having a strong promotional video can help your business stand-out amongst a sea of competitors. Consumers like to know who they’re doing business with, and videos can help them understand who you are and what you do. If leveraged correctly, video marketing can help promote your brand and grow your business.</p>
<p>Here are a few ways you can use harness the power of videos to market your business:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Show Off Your Product or Service</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Trying to explain what your product does or how your company handles business can be an arduous task. Videos can help get your point across quickly and efficiently. Show your consumers exactly what it is that sets your product apart with a video demonstration. Consumers today are visual learners with short attention spans, so videos can be a great way to disseminate information.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Video Testimonials</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Testimonial videos can be a powerful tool to build your credibility as a business and brand. Consumers tend to be wary of advertising and promotional material, so testimonials are a great way to show potential consumers that you can “walk the walk”. If you’re able to rally a few of your biggest fans, you can create a very powerful marketing video of testimonials from happy customers.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Share Your Passion</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Is your business devoted to environmentally conscious and sustainable practices? Make a video about it! Consumers are becoming increasingly curious about how their products are made. It may not always affect purchasing decisions, but potential and current consumers will feel better knowing that the products they are using were produced in an earth-friendly way (or by a company that values sustainable methods).</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong>Introduce Your Staff</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Adding a personal touch to your brand can make a big impact. Consumers enjoy getting a look at the inner-workings of the companies they interact with. Use your marketing video as an opportunity to show off why your staff is so great and what your team is passionate about. Business videos about your team can make your company seem more relatable and can foster a sense of trust between consumer and company.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li><strong>What’s Coming Next?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Videos are a great way to give your customers and potential customers a sneak peek at what’s next! Are you working on a brand new product design, recipe or concept? Whatever you’re excited to share about your company, share it! Announcing your upcoming projects or what’s new with the company can make for great video content, and you can easily share links with your fans on social media.</p>
<p>Producing a few well-made business videos can help market and propel your business forward. Videos are easily shared content that can live on your website and various social media pages.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://ianhvideo.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/video-943579_1280.jpg" class="themewich-lightbox"><img class="normal alignnone size-medium wp-image-249" src="http://ianhvideo.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/video-943579_1280-600x400.jpg" alt="video-943579_1280" width="300" height="200" /></a></p>
<p>Planning and producing a successful corporate video can be a challenging task. Pit the average attention span against the amount of information it takes to thoroughly communicate a corporate brand identity—we’re not looking at a winning situation. Corporate videos should clearly communicate what your brand is about, what the unique value proposition your product or service has to offer, why your company should be considered over your competition, and how you plan on delivering high-quality service (among other things). Whether this is your first or fifteenth corporate video, here are a few tips to help make it a successful one.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Hire a Professional</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>This may be an obvious first step, but it should be stated. Hiring a video production company or videographer for your corporate video can be an invaluable asset. Videographers can provide insight on scripts, lighting, logistics, editing, and every other nuance in the video production process.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Know Your Audience</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Define your target audience and speak to them. Having general appeal is nice, but paring down your strategic approach is nicer. Be very specific about how your company or product will improve the life of your target consumer. Give your ideal client a name and backstory, and tailor your messaging to the character you’ve created.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Craft a Specific Message</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Whether you’re creating a video about a product launch or putting a face to your corporate ‘About Us’ page, you need to be very specific about the purpose of your video. If you’re trying to get too many points across you may lose your audience, and if you’re not specific with messaging you may miss an opportunity. A great way to judge message clarity is to ask an outside source for their honest opinion. Don’t give them any context, and see if they can understand what message you are trying to convey.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong>Make an Emotional Connection</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Purchase decisions are typically emotional ones. Listing facts and benefits about your product or company is great, but also leave some room for a deeper connection with your target audience. How has your product affected someone’s life? Tell a moving story to help connect readers to your brand on an emotional level.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li><strong>Show Don’t Tell</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>If you are able to, you should show-off what your product or service can do instead of speak of it. Consumers tend to be very visual, and a visceral experience can convey a great deal of information in an abbreviated amount of time. Keep your audiences captivated by showing instead of telling.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li><strong>Be Human</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Many companies put emphasis on the conveyance of information in their videos but forget that personality is just as important. Consumers want to connect and relate to your brand. Share what you believe in as a leader and not just what your company does. Consumers crave a certain level of transparency in the businesses they interact with. Divulging some personal information about yourself can help consumers make an invaluable connection to your company.</p>
<ol start="7">
<li><strong>Promote Your Video</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The final cut and upload shouldn’t be the conclusion to your corporate video journey. Posting your video on your website isn’t doing all of your hard work any justice. To maximize your opportunities, throw your corporate video on YouTube, email your clients with the exciting news, and pitch the video to relevant PR outlets. Be sure to measure and evaluate your video’s performance through analytics.</p>

<a href="http://ianhvideo.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/bow-tie-businessman-fashion-man.jpg" class="themewich-lightbox"><img class="normal wp-image-183 alignright" src="http://ianhvideo.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/bow-tie-businessman-fashion-man-600x400.jpg" alt="bow-tie-businessman-fashion-man" width="401" height="268" srcset="https://harringtonweddings.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/bow-tie-businessman-fashion-man-600x400.jpg 600w, https://harringtonweddings.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/bow-tie-businessman-fashion-man-1500x1000.jpg 1500w, https://harringtonweddings.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/bow-tie-businessman-fashion-man-960x640.jpg 960w" sizes="(max-width: 401px) 100vw, 401px" /></a></strong><br />
Videos are a great way to spread information about your company. They can educate, entertain and engage your audience. These are all positive benefits of video marketing.</p>
<p>With the rise of video marketing platforms, knowing how to get your information across via video is becoming increasingly important. You can touch a wide audience net with video and video-friendly platforms like: YouTube, Instagram, Vine, and Facebook.</p>
<p>Whether you’re using video to explain a product or market a service, you’ll need to be camera-ready. You’re the face of your company. You want to put your best foot forward.</p>
<h4>Here are a few tips to help you make the best business video ever.</h4>
<ol>
<li><strong>Overemphasize everything</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The camera doesn’t pick up on subtleties and nuances, so over-exaggerate everything you do. Speak loudly, articulate your words, increase your volume, and overemphasize your gestures—it may seem strange but this will all look great on film.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Project confidence (or fake it)</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>If you’re not a natural in front of the camera—fake it! To exude more confidence, articulate your words, speak loudly, and have good posture. These are just a few small things that can help you seem more confident on camera. To help keep your posture properly aligned, stand-up against a wall and push your shoulders and head against it, and maintain that posture while you’re in front the camera.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Wear medium colors</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Avoid stark white, bright yellows and all black outfits. Avoid distracting patterns like polka dots, plaids, and anything that will reflect too much light. Avoid shiny jewelry as well. Be sure that the clothes you do wear are comfortable so that you can feel confident while making your video.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong>Be clear and concise</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Write out your script and rehearse beforehand—this can help prevent rambling and going off on a tangent. Audiences typically have short attention spans, so the more efficiently you can convey your message—the better. If you’re answering questions in an interview try to answer in one or two bullet points and make sure the most powerful answer/statement comes first.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li><strong>Look into the camera</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The camera is your audience, so be sure to look into it for the duration of your video. If you want to practice maintaining eye contact before shooting your video, draw a circle on a post-it and practice speaking while focusing on the circle. This exercise can help you feel comfortable focusing on one area while speaking.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li><strong>Be yourself</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>This may sound like it’s contradicting some of our previous tips, but it’s important to be yourself (just the slightly louder and more articulate version). People can sense when you are being inauthentic, so stay true to your own personality.</p>
<p>Utilizing video is a great way to market your product, service or company. With the rise of video marketing and visual media, creating engaging video content is becoming increasingly important. Use the tips above to get camera-ready for your next business video.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>What did the highest grossing Kickstarter campaigns of 2014 all have in common? Aside from promoting a few innovative products, each campaign had a compelling Kickstarter video.</strong></p>
<p>According to Kickstarter “projects with videos succeed at a much higher rate than those without (50% vs. 30%)”. Campaigns with videos help companies communicate every aspect of their project in one concise stream of thought. So how do you make your Kickstarter campaign video a success? Here are six helpful tips to get you started.</p>
<h4>1. Be Authentic</h4>
<p>The Kickstarter community wants to know who you are and where your passions lie. They want to know why your product is important to you and why you’re the most competent person to deliver this product to them. Keep the energy levels high and a smile on your face throughout your Kickstarter video—you’re selling your dream here after all.</p>
<h4>2. What’s being Kickstarted?</h4>
<p>Be sure to have a very clear description of your product in the video. This may seem fairly obvious, but this is the most helpful tip of all. You may know the ins and outs of your project, but your audience needs a very clear picture of what’s going on. To test out the potential success of your Kickstarter video, show it to a sample audience of friends that don’t have any information about your product yet. Listen very closely to your test audience and augment or reduce information as needed.</p>
<h4>3. Cover the basics</h4>
<p>Every successful Kickstarter video should answer the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Who are you?</li>
<li>What’s the backstory for your product?</li>
<li>Why do you need my money?</li>
<li>What will you do with my money?</li>
<li>What do I get for my money?</li>
<li>What happens if you don’t reach your funding goals? (i.e. The Universe may collapse into itself…)</li>
</ul>
<h4>4. Be Concise</h4>
<p>Cover all the topics above (of course), but keep in mind that the average attention span is laughable. Use the first 10 seconds of your video to hook your audience and convince them that they should stay tuned for the main event. Aim for a video that covers all the bases in the span of 3-5 minutes.</p>
<h4>5. Keep Things Legal</h4>
<p>Be wary of violating copyright law—you will need permission to use any logos, photos and music used in your video. Royalty-free content may be a great option for photos and music. If you’re using the services of a professional videographer, they can provide insight on what music and images to use.</p>
<h4>6. Close the Sale</h4>
<p>Have a very specific call to action to conclude your Kickstarter campaign video. Be as specific as telling your audience what button to press to donate. You don’t have to assume the role of pushy salesperson in your video, just treat your audience like a friend you’re asking to borrow money from. Let them know how much you want to borrow, why you need it, and how you’ll repay them.</p>
<p>There’s no foolproof method for creating a successful Kickstarter campaign, but having a compelling video will create more opportunities for funding. Videos are the best and easiest way to share your project and showcase the emotions, motivations and passion behind your brand. Give your Kickstarter campaign the best possible chance for success with the tips above.</p>
